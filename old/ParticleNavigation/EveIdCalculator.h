/// This is the base class for an algorithm to calculate the "eve
/// ID". This begs two questions:

/// - What is an eve ID?

/// - What does it mean to be a base class?

/// The "eve ID" is the ultimate "mother" of a particle in a shower
/// produced by the detector simulation. Consider the following
/// example chain of particles:

/// TrackID   Particle       "Mother"
///     2       pi+              0
///   101       nu_mu            2
///   102       mu+              2
///   341       nu_mu_bar      102 
///   342       nu_e           102
///   343       e+             102
///  1022       gamma          343
///  1123       e+            1022
///  1124       e-            1022

/// The "mother" (or parent) particle of track ID 1123 is 1022; the
/// "mother" of track ID 102 is 2. The mother of ID 2 is 0 because it
/// is a primary particle, created by the event generator instead of
/// the detector simulation.

/// The track IDs were originally assigned by the simulation. Each
/// particle is stored in a simb::MCParticle object. All of the particles
/// for a given event are stored in a sim::ParticleList object.

/// When you are studying an event, especially one with many primary
/// particles, it can be helpful to go up the decay chain, from
/// "child" to mother to "grand-mother", to eventually the ultimate
/// mother particle of the chain. The track ID of the ultimate mother
/// is the "eve ID".

/// In the above example, if we want the eve ID to refer to primary
/// particles, the eve ID of track ID 1123 is 2.

/// This class is never called directly. Instead, it's invoked
/// indirectly via the sim::ParticleList class. For example:

///    const sim::ParticleList* particleList = // ... from somewhere
///    int trackID = // ... an ID you select according to some criteria
///    int eveID = particleList->EveId( trackID );

/// The class below defines the eve ID to be a primary particle that
/// comes from the event. But what if you want a different definition
/// of the ultimate mother; for example, perhaps you only want to go
/// up the chain of particles for basic e-m showers, but stop at more
/// significant physics; for example, in the chain above, you might
/// want the eve ID of track 1123 to be 343, since all the particles
/// descended from 343 are part of the same e-m shower.

/// You can override the default calculation of this class (the "base"
/// calculation) with one of your own. For an example of how to do
/// this, see EmEveIdCalculator.h.

/// (If you're familiar with design patterns, this base class
/// implements the Template Method. No, this has nothing to do with
/// C++ templates; see "Design Patterns" by Gemma et al., or
/// "Effective C++" by Scott Meyers.)
