   * @brief An art service to assist in the distribution of guaranteed unique
   * seeds to all engines within an art job.
   * @see SeedMaster
   *
   * NuRandomService centrally manages seeds for random generator engines.
   *
   * The NuRandomService acts as an interface between art framework and the
   * SeedMaster class.
   *
   * The documentation is mantained in the SeedMaster class.
   * The configuration of NuRandomService is exactly the same as SeedMaster's,
   * and in art it's read from `services.NuRandomService`.
   * The following documentation describes features of NuRandomService that are
   * built on top of SeedMaster to have a more convenient interaction within
   * the art framework.
   *
   * Before asking NuRandomService for its seed, an engine must be in some way
   * registered. Once the engine is registered, its original seed can be queried
   * again by calling `getSeed()` methods.
   *
   *
   * Glossary
   * ---------
   *
   * Here "engine" means a class that is able to generate random numbers
   * according to a flat distribution.
   * Both art and NuRandomService are module-based, that means that the engines
   * are in the context of a specific module instance, and different module
   * instances have independent engines.
   * That is the reason why you don't need to specify anything about the module
   * when creating or obtaining a random engine, and it is also the reason why
   * engines outside module context are not supported by the framework.
   *
   * Each module can need more than one engine. A module can have any number of
   * engines, and each of them is identified by an "instance name" that is
   * unique within the module.
   * Nonetheless, most modules need just one engine. In that case, a default
   * instance name can be used (that is an empty string).
   *
   * A "seeder" is a callable object (e.g. a function) that sets the seed of
   * a certain engine. The seeder is expected to find out by its own which
   * engine it has to seed, and fot that it is provided an engine ID.
   *
   *
   * Registration of a random generator engine
   * ------------------------------------------
   *
   * Registration must happen in art module constructor, in one of the following
   * ways:
   *  * by asking this service to create an engine via RandomNumberGenerator
   *    (see `createEngine()` methods) [discouraged]
   *  * by registering an existing engine and its seeding function
   *    (see `registerEngine()` methods)
   *  * by just declaring that an engine exists
   *    (see `declareEngine()` and `getSeed()` methods)
   * The first method and, when a seeder or an engine is provided, also the
   * second method, set the seed of the engine they register (see below).
   * In the third case, it is generally the caller's responsibility to seed the
   * engine. The registration of an engine which has been only declared can be
   * "completed" by calling `defineEngine()` to provide the actual seeder for
   * that engine. The pair of calls `declareEngine()`/`defineEngine()` (or
   * `getSeed()`/`defineEngine()`) is equivalent to a single call to
   * `registerEngine()`, with the added flexibility of having the seed for the
   * engine already available before the registration is completed.
   *
   * The use of createEngine() class of function is discouraged and this
   * function might be removed in the future, because of its non-clean use of
   * module interfaces.
   * The recommended approach is more prolix; here an example for an engine with
   * a non-default instance name:
   *
   *     std::string const instanceName = "instanceName";
   *     auto& Seeds = *(art::ServiceHandle<rndm::NuRandomService>());
   *
   *     // declare an engine; NuRandomService associates an (unknown) engine, in
   *     // the current module and an instance name, with a seed (returned)
   *     auto const seed = Seeds.declareEngine(instanceName);
   *
   *     // now create the engine (for example, use art); seed will be set
   *     createEngine(seed, "HepJamesRandom", instanceName);
   *
   *     // finally, complete the registration; seed will be set again
   *     art::ServiceHandle<art::RandomNumberGenerator> RNG;
   *     Seeds.defineEngine(RNG->getEngine(instanceName));
   *
   * This is equivalent to the discouraged call
   *
   *     auto& Seeds = *(art::ServiceHandle<rndm::NuRandomService>());
   *     Seeds.createEngine(*this, "HepJamesRandom", "instanceName");
   *
   * Please read carefully the documentation of the method of your choice, since
   * they have different requirements and apply to different usage patterns.
   *
   * The registration must happen in the constructor of the module.
   * That is because we don't want engines to be initialized in the middle of a
   * job.
   *
   *
   * Setting the seed of an engine
   * ------------------------------
   *
   * NuRandomService is able to set the seed of an engine when the engine is
   * registered via either:
   *  * `createEngine()` (creation of a new CLHEP engine)
   *  * `registerEngine()` (registration of an engine or a seeder function),
   *    if the registered seeder function is valid (non-null) or if a CLHEP
   *    engine is being registered (in which case the seeder is automatically
   *    created valid)
   *  * `defineEngine()` (registration of a seeder for an engine that was
   *    already declared), again if the seed is valid
   * NuRandomService is *not* able to automatically set the seed of an engine if
   * it was registered via either:
   *  * `declareEngine()` (declaration of the existence of an engine),
   *    that does not even require the engine to exist
   *  * `getSeed()` (query of a seed), when it (implicitly) declares an engine
   *    which had not been declared yet
   *
   * If NuRandomService is able to set the seed, it will do so only once, as soon as
   * it can.
   * This means that if the policy allows the seed to be known immediately,
   * the seed will be set on registration. In the case of a per-event policy
   * that requires the presence of an event, the seed can be known only
   * when the event is available, and NuRandomService will set the seed before the
   * module the engine is associated with starts its main processing method
   * (produce(), filter() or analyze()).
   *
   *
   * Changing the seeder
   * --------------------
   *
   * Currently, changing the seeder of an engine after the engine has been
   * fully registered is not supported. As a consequence, changing the engine
   * is also not supported.
   *
   * Since only the seeder function is registered in NuRandomService, a seeder
   * function that is flexible enough to change the engine it seeds may work
   * around this limitation.
   *
   *
   * Querying the seed of an engine
   * -------------------------------
   *
   * If necessary, the seed that NuRandomService has assigned to an engine can be
   * requested by one of the following two calls:
   *
   *     art::ServiceHandle<NuRandomService>->getSeed();
   *     art::ServiceHandle<NuRandomService>->getSeed("instanceName");
   *
   * depending on whether the engine has a non-empty instance name,
   * Note that this call implicitly "declares" the engine it refers to.
   *
   * For most policies, the seed is set according to the configuration, once
   * for all. In those cases, `getSeed()` will always return the same value.
   * If the policy prescribes different seeds at different times, the method
   * returns the seed that is assigned to the engine at the time of the call.
   *
   * Also note that the seed assigned by NuRandomService might not match the current
   * seed of the engine, if:
   *  * NuRandomService is not in charge of setting the seed of the engine,
   *    and the engine seed has not been set yet
   *  * the seed was reset directly after NuRandomService set the engine seed
   * Both circumstances should be avoided.
   *
   *
   * Creating the engines independently of NuRandomService
   * --------------------------------------------------
   *
   * A number of things must happen for an engine to correctly work with
   * NuRandomService:
   *  * the engine instance needs to exist or be created
   *  * the engine must be "registered" into NuRandomService
   *  * the seed must be obtained from NuRandomService
   *  * the seed must be provided to the engine
   *
   * A recipe for creating a ROOT engine and let NuRandomService take care of its
   * seeds is:
   *
   *     // create the engine; ROOT will set some (temporary) seed
   *     fRandom = std::make_unique<TRandom3>();
   *
   *     // declare the engine; NuRandomService associates its seeder, in
   *     // the current module and an instance name, with a seed (returned);
   *     // the seed is also set in the engine
   *     auto& Seeds = *(art::ServiceHandle<rndm::NuRandomService>());
   *     Seeds.registerEngine(TRandomSeeder(fRandom), "instanceName");
   *
   * Here `fRandom` is supposed to be a member function of the module.
   * The `TRandomSeeder` object is an object that knows how to set the seed
   * of the TRandom-derived ROOT generator passed as constructor argument.
   * For an example of implementation, see the source code of NuRandomService.
   *
   *
   * Overriding the seed from NuRandomService at run time
   * -------------------------------------------------
   *
   * NuRandomService (and SeedMaster, which the former relies upon) will decide
   * which seed to give to each registered engine and, when possible
   * (see above), will set that seed too.
   *
   * All registration functions offer an extended signature to tell NuRandomService
   * that if there is an explicitly configured seed, that should take presedence
   * over the one automatically assigned by SeedMaster policy.
   * This extended signature includes:
   *  * a FHiCL parameter set
   *  * a configuration parameter name, or a list of them
   * NuRandomService will look in the specified parameter set and if it finds a
   * value corresponding to any of the specified parameter names, will set
   * the seed of the engine to that value, and it will mark the engine as
   * "frozen" (meaning that NuRandomService will not ever set a seed again on that
   * engine). [see also the exception to this rule below]
   *
   * The typical use of this function is to read a parameter ("Seed" is the
   * suggested name) from the configuration of the module. Note that this is in
   * contrast with the location where NuRandomService seeds are normally configured,
   * that is in the configuration of NuRandomService service itself.
   * For example:
   *
   *     // within module construction:
   *     art::ServiceHandle<rndm::NuRandomService>()->registerEngine
   *       (engine, "instanceName", pset, { "Seed", "MySeed" });
   *
   * Here NuRandomService will provide a seed only if it does not find in the
   * parameter set `pset` any of the specified configuration parameters (first
   * "Seed", then "MySeed" in this example). In other words, if "Seed" exists,
   * its value is used as seed, otherwise if "MySeed" exists, its value is used
   * instead, and otherwise NuRandomService is given control on that seed.
   * The exception is that if the specified seed is a "magic value", the
   * `InvalidSeed` (`0`), it is interpreted as a request to ignore the parameter
   * and use the service to get the seed. This is made as a quick way to remove
   * the seed override from an existing FHiCL file with one line.
   * Note that if NuRandomService does not get the control on the seed,
   * policies that reseed on event-by-event basis will not act on the engine.
   *
   *
   * Engines outside of the module context
   * ======================================
   *
   * It is possible to have engines that are not associated with any module.
   * If no module is current, an engine will be registered in a "global"
   * context. This happens during service construction, and once the service
   * construction phase is completed, no more global engines can be registered.
   * Would one ever need to access the seed of such engine, a specific
   * interface needs to be used: `getGlobalSeed()` to get the configured seed
   * at the beginning of the job, or `getGlobalCurrentSeed()` to get the seed
   * specific for the current event, if any. These are equivalent to the module
   * context methods `getSeed()` and `getCurrentSeed()`.
   *
   * The art service RandomNumberGenerator does not support the creation of
   * module-independent engines. The ownership of each global engine is by the
   * using service, as well as the management of engine's lifetime.
   * After an engine has been instantiated, it can be registered with
   * `registerEngine()`. Likewise, a global engine can be declared first with
   * `declareEngine()`, then instantiated, and then optionally defined with
   * `defineEngine()`. This is completely analogous to the module-context
   * engines. The only difference is that no `createEngine()` interface is
   * available for global engines.
   * Whether these methods create a global or module engine depends only
   * on the context they are called in.
   *
   * NuRandomService does not manage the engine life in any way. If a service owns
   * an engine, it also needs a way to access it, as nothing equivalent to
   * RandomNumberGenerator's `getEngine()` is provided.
   * NuRandomService does manage the seeding of the registered engines, even the
   * global ones. If the seed policy involves a event-dependent seed, all global
   * engines are seeded together at the beginning of the event, before any
   * module is executed. This mechanism relies on the fact that NuRandomService gets
   * its preProcessEvent callback executed before the ones of the services that
   * own any engine. This is guaranteed if the service constructors invoke
   * NuRandomService before they register their callbacks.
   *
   * For an example of usage, see GlobalEngineUserTestService service in the
   * test suite. Here is an excerpt using a ROOT TRandom3 engine, that can
   * be constructed without seed. In the service constructor, the code:
   *
   *     // create a new engine, that we own (engine be a class data member)
   *     engine = std::make_unique<TRandom3>();
   *     auto seed = Seeds.registerEngine
   *       (rndm::NuRandomService::TRandomSeeder(engine.get()), "MyService");
   *
   *     // MyService callback registrations in the ActivityRegistry
   *     // should follow the first call to NuRandomService!
   *
   * where rndm::NuRandomService::TRandomSeeder is a seeder class for TRandom
   * engines (optionally provided in NuRandomService.h, and very easy to write).
   * This excerpt creates and owns a TRandom3 engine, and then it registers it
   * to NuRandomService, which immediately sets its seed and will take care of
   * reseeding the engine at each event, should the policy require it.
   * The service will access the engine as a data member, and should it need the
   * seed it will use:
   *
   *     art::ServiceHandle<rndm::NuRandomService>()->getGlobalSeed("MyService");
   *
   * Note that is a good idea to give the engine an instance name after the
   * service name itself, since the instance name is global and it's the only
   * thing distinguishing global engines, and name conflicts between different
   * services may easily arise.

     * the registered engine is no different from any other, created by
     * RandomNumberGenerator or not.

     * Three standard functions are provided as seeders, for use with
     * RandomNumberGenerator engines (RandomNumberGeneratorSeeder()),
     * with a CLHEP::HepRandomEngine (CLHEPengineSeeder class) and with ROOT's
